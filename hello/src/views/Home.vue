          <v-card-subtitle>Welcome to my personal web</v-card-subtitle>
          <v-card-text>
            Jorge here, a madrile√±o (for those visiting from outside Spain that
            means I'm form Madrid). <br /><br />I work as Data Scientist and
            this site is one example of the things I like to do in my free time.
            <br /><br />
            Have a look here if you want to know more about me! In theory you
            should find here info related to my career and studies and free
            time. Enjoy it &#128556;<br /><br />Cheers
